# Overview of the project

## Backend:
This project follows the Pluralsight [ASP.NET Core 6 Web API Fundamental](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/asp-dot-net-core-6-web-api-fundamentals/table-of-contents) from [Kevin Dockx](https://app.pluralsight.com/profile/author/kevin-dockx).

The course covers the following:

* Getting Acquainted with ASP.NET Core
* Creating the API and returning resources
* Manipulating resources and validating input
* Working with services and dependency injection
* Getting Acquainted with Entity Framework Core
* Using entity Framework Core in your controllers
* Searching, Filtering and Paging resources
* Securing your API
* Versioning and documenting your API

CORS was not covered, but was added to make sure the frontend could retrieve the resources from the backend.

## Frontend:
The frontend is going to be written in Vue, with Typescript and Tailwind. More info to come.
